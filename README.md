### CollegeDatabaseWebScraper 

## Overview

This is a web scraper made from python and the library beautiful soup. This program take data from [CollegeVine](https://www.collegevine.com/)'s website containing data about different colleges across the United States, and my program will display that data for a specfic school that you enter into the program.

## How to Run

1. Clone/Download the GitHub repository onto your local machine <br>
2. Open the webscrape.py file, and run it in your desired ide or python interepreter <br>

## Notes
If the program doesn't output data (it will throw an error): <br>
1. CollegeVine doesn't have data for that specfic university <br>
2. The name of the university/college is incorrect. You need to enter the full name of the university/college. <br>
3. You forgot to enter "University" or "College" after the school name (Ex, "Amherst College", "Purdue University", "New York University")

Ex, If I wanted to get statistics for these universities: <br>

UC Berkeley = "University of California Berkeley" <br>
UC Davis = "University of California Davis" <br>
UW Seattle = "University of Washington" <br>
Georgia Tech = "Georgia Tech Institute of Technology"

## TODO

1. Add GUI???
